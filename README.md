ï™‹ Hi there. My name is Nana Yaa Boahemaa Boahene. I am a nurse by profession and a big IT enthusiast.  IT has become a very important faculty in health. Thanks to technology, we can boast of immense improvement in the health field. I strongly believe we can even do more in this field, hence my keen interest in learning how to code.
